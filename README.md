# GGR472 Lab 4
This repository contains an HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GeoJSON file that make up my webpage, which uses a hexgrid map to visualize the number of road collisions involving cyclists and pedestrians in Toronto.

## Repository Contents
**index.html:** This HTML file renders the map, includes necessary links to the CSS and JavaScript pages, and adds text to explain the webpage.

**style.css:** This CSS file positions the map, legend, and geocoded search function.

**script.js:** This JavaScript file contains code for classifying data and updating paint properties, as well as code for handling events.

**pedcyc_collision_06-21.geojson:** This GeoJSON file contains the location of each road collision involving cyclists and pedestrians in Toronto. The file includes additional information on the collision, such as the year, the road conditions, the neighborhood where it occurred, and outcomes of the collision.
